# Building and Running

To run this extension, you'll need to open a VSCode window rooted in this
directory. From a terminal in that window:
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run compile` (or press Cmd-Shift-B)
- Press F5 to launch an extension host window
  - If this prompts you with a menu of choices, choose the one that mentions
    "Extension Development"
